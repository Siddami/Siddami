## A **Frontend Developer** and **Tech Enthusiast** with a background in **Sociology** from the University of Ilorin. I‚Äôm also a **certified Frontend Developer** from the [3MTT Software Engineering](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Fkqiaes32CLdGhBA88sgnznIJ8smGKrQ/view?usp=sharing) track and have completed [CS50‚Äôs Introduction to Computer Science](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bbpY7yy-bWFx3Ydag9qH_dSx493hLtmE/view?usp=sharing).  

I specialize in building **user-centric, accessible, and responsive web experiences** that are both visually engaging and highly functional. My journey in tech has been fueled by continuous learning, including completing the **[100DaysOfCode](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/siddiqat_100daysofcode-100daysofcode-womentechsters-activity-7227420303662956546-F5E8?) challenge**, where I leveraged resources like **[Asabeneh 30 Days of JavaScript](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript)** to strengthen my skills.  

With a robust foundation in web development and an expanding portfolio of projects, I excel in addressing challenges, creating cohesive designs, and engaging in collaborative efforts on significant projects. My objective is to continue to add value to any organization I work with through dedication, transparency, and a commitment to excellence in every endeavor I undertake.
